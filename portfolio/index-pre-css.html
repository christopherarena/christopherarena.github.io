        <h4>A little bit about me!</h4>
        	<p>Hello, my name is Christopher Arena. I was born in the Bronx NY and I love to cook whenever I get the chance. While traveling around Hawaii I learned to cook from some of the best Chefs on the Islands. The most notable was Amy Ferguson (facebook like) the 1st Executive Female Chef at the Ritz Carlton. Over the years I have either cooked or worked with computers in some way. Now at the University of Connecticut. I begin my journey in Digital Media bringing over 50 years of experience. If you have time please check out my new student project, The BigDogProject.com. It was a pleasure...

        	</P>
